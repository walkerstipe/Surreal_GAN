surreal GAN paper

Why important to entangle further? (Other than empirically and Hinton paper). Synesthesia, lsd, asmr and foot fetishes! A disentangled mind can't be affected by these; a fully entangled net, (Biological or otherwise), can. I propose this is one of the reasons humans have the capacity for effective system 1. intuitions. As well as this is the means, (Thalamus anyone? Hello Hogan twins), by which system 1. and system 2. (Concious, uncouncious), can not only communicate but also do so seamlessly and vitally(!) in the same language, (i.e. high dimensional vector space). Stoked about this shit. (don't forget CLIP, DAL-E, DINO, PAWS, as recent advances in this direction that is showing GREAT promise on so many axis (ax-ees?); particularly a high dimensional vector space that succesfuly encapsulates both visual and textual modalities. Avocado penguins and buldogs I mean cmooooon! 

Experiments:
1. Frozen lake simple case
2. Big experiment, (or, rather, using big pre-trained model)
